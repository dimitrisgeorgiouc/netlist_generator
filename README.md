Reference Implementations

This work also reproduces some variants of existing DAG generators as a control group, based on prior work:

GNM [1]

LBL (Layer-by-Layer) [2]

FIO (Fan-In/Fan-Out) [3]

SoTA (State-of-the-Art) [4]

These implementations are included for comparison and benchmarking purposes.

This version:

Clarifies that reproducing prior DAG generators is for benchmarking / control purposes, not claiming originality.

Uses consistent formatting for parameters and references.

Improves readability and flow while keeping technical accuracy.
